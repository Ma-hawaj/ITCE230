# ITCE230 Project

## Objective
The main objective is to design and implement a system that can read the temperature of its environment and display it on a pair of 7 segment displays. Also, it should activate a siren when the temperature reaches a specific number that can be changed. Moreover, another task of the system is to activate an LED light based on motion with a certain delay after the motion stops and this delay can be changed. The system should toggle between the previous tasks using a button.  
## Question to be answered
1.	What sensors will be needed?
2.	How to read these sensors signals?
3.	How the System task can be changed?
4.	How the toggle temperature and the delay time can be changed?
5.	How to generate this delay?
6.	How the to process the input signals to output the correct values for the output devices?
